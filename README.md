SuperCollider code to create sound groups (populations) using a Genetic Algorithm (Nature Toolkit Quark)

In the AfterSavev1.1 script you can find a GUI where you can create generation after generation by doing the fitness selection manually. It uses classes definied in the extension. To load these classes, theses class-files have to be in the extension directory of SuperCollider. More Information about the exact working principle you can find in the pdf.
